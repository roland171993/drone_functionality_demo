/**
	 A set of quantities from which other quantities are calculated.
	 
	 
	 For the OGC abstract model, it can be defined as a set of real points on the earth 
	 that have coordinates. EG. A datum can be thought of as a set of parameters 
	 defining completely the origin and orientation of a coordinate system with respect 
	 to the earth. A textual description and/or a set of parameters describing the 
	 relationship of a coordinate system to some predefined physical locations (such 
	 as center of mass) and physical directions (such as axis of spin). The definition 
	 of the datum may also include the temporal behavior (such as the rate of change of
	 the orientation of the coordinate axes).
